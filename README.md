# Clarios-Research-Allocation
Using SQLite3, Pandas, &amp; Matplotlib to analyze market trends of EV, PHEV and ICE vehicles to efficiently allocate battery research of lithium and lead acid for Clarios and its subsidiaries (Varta,Heliar,Delkor, etc...). The laptop that had the code is bricked therefore I only have the spreadsheet that showcases the data, but thankfully the spreadsheet has the important parts of the code.
